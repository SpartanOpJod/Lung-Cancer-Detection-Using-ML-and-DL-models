Hey guys , This is my Final year project in which we took the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images
As the First step In this project I perform data augmentation using on the fly model to augment the the data.
Then the data was trained using different Ml and DL models like Transformers, Resnet etc.
The best model was came out to be EfficientNet which gave a accuracy of 93.3 percent
Then hybrid optimization was performed on the EfficientNet  using Blue whale optimization and Penguin optimization
The optimized accuracy of the efficientnet after optimization came out to be 96.6 percent.
